# sodiumoxide2

Less Chlorides, more Oxides!

This package is a fork of sodiumoxide, using rust-native crypto. It's not intended to be easy to use
or implement the most secure crypto. It is however a drop in replacement for sodiumoxide.

> [sodiumoxide](https://github.com/sodiumoxide/sodiumoxide) is a rust library that provides high-level 
bindings to libsodium

> [Sodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of NaCl (based on the latest released upstream version nacl-20110221), with a compatible API.

> [NaCl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to) (pronounced "salt") is a new easy-to-use high-speed software library for network communication, encryption, decryption, signatures, etc. NaCl's goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.
> Of course, other libraries already exist for these core operations. NaCl advances the state of the art by improving security, by improving usability, and by improving speed.
